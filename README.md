### High Risk Investment

Trading cryptocurrencies carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. Before deciding to trade cryptocurrency you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor. Invest at your own risk!

**Welcome to Dexminer Finance!**

**Team Dexminer has full analyzed the crypto space with emphasis on Titano type forks. There's ALOT of these project's being released raising $1 Million plus dollars with absolutely NO intention  on further marketing the project AFTER the presale ends! Leaving the investors who truly believed the Hype of a long term stability of a recurring revenue when in actuality the project owners having NO intentions other then getting the upfront BNB to just completely abandon the project and or really not know what it takes to TRULY market a crypto project.**

The Stablecoin will be a EXTRA leverage for investors as it is pegged 1:1 with $BUSD on the Binance Smart Chain to allow investors to swap $BUSD for $OCASH and "Farm,Stake,Borrow & Swap" for $DEX Tokens. All this can be done in our custom made Dapp! Other Utilities will be announced as we update our whitepaper as the  project progresses. This is currently V0.7 of the whitepaper. Stay Tuned!**
