<mark style="background-color:purple;">NO TEAM TOKENS</mark> **-** The Dexminer Team will **NOT** hold any tokens. The only tokens owned by the Dexminer Treasury will be collected via accumulating trading fees. We are committed to the longevity of the project and thus the $DXM team cannot dump on you.

\
<mark style="background-color:purple;">NO EXTRA MINT OR HIDDEN TOKENS</mark> **-** The $DXM smart contract has **NO** ability to mint extra tokens nor can the supply be manually increased or used in an artificial way to change the initial supply by awarding ourselves free tokens. The initial supply is 250,000 $DXM  tokens only (please see the breakdown above).\
