# âš™ How Does Auto-Staking Work?

The Dexminer Finance Auto-Stake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called **Buy-Hold-Earn**, that provides the ultimate ease of use for $DXM holders.

Buy-Hold-Earn - By simply buying and holding $DXM token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase <mark style="background-color:purple;">every</mark> <mark style="background-color:purple;"></mark><mark style="background-color:purple;"><mark style="color:green;"><mark style="color:green;"></mark> <mark style="background-color:purple;"></mark><mark style="background-color:purple;">2 seconds</mark><mark style="color:green;"><mark style="color:green;">.<mark style="color:green;"></mark>

Using a Positive Rebase formula, Dexminer makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, worth 0.0000596% / 2 seconds epoch period of the total amount of $DXM tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each EPOCH (2 seconds rebase period) to all $DXM holders.

**This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, Dexminer holders receive an annual compound interest of**  <mark style="background-color:purple;">422,252.66%%</mark> **for Year 1.**

The interest rebase rate then reduces after the first 12 months.
