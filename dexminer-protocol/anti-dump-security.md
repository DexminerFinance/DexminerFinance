# ðŸ›¡ Anti-Dump Security

The project analysis center of the Dexminer Finance team analyzed the current scenario, and concluded that there are many projects without fundamentals and concerns about your investors, without technological, physical and even systemic basis, and thus have had several inconsistencies in the market, such as capturing investors' liquidity in the long term.

With this, we have found a common denominator to protect the greatest asset of Dexminer Finance, the investor. We created an anti-dumping system, where your investors can sell between 1% and 5% per day, according to the volume generated by the purchases and sales of the token.
