#### 1. What is Dexminer BANK?

* You lock Dexminer (any period from 1 day to 4 years) in the Dexminer Bank to receive X Dexminer token as a receipt. (Proportionally, the longer you lock, the more xDexminer  you will receive. A 4-year lock will give a 1:1 ratio of Dexminer to xDexminer conversion.)
* By just holding xDexminer , everyday you get BUSD reward from 4% Dexminer trading volume, plus 1.16% Dexminer interest (auto-compound to 422,252.66%APY for you). You will get back your locked amount after 60 days if you lock for 4 years.
* BUSD rewards are calculated based on your proportion percentage of the overall xDexminer  in circulation, this percentage gives you a proportional access to the funds accumulated from the pool collected from the 4% Dexminer trading volume, accumulated from the buy & sell tax.
* xDexminer holders can vote in Dexminer DAO governance for important factors such as transaction tax change...
* You can unlock xDexminer  before time but 80% of your locked Dexminer will be burnt.

#### 2. Why Dexminer Bank is an innovative feature that helps the Dexminer system long term?

How does Dexminer Bank play a crucial part in keeping Dexminer value sustainable long term?

* The more people that lock their Dexminer to xDexminer , (usually from 2 weeks to 4 years), the fewer Dexminer tokens are in circulation. The price of a token is based on supply/demand. So xDexminer  will help reduce the supply and increased the demand of Dexminer as new investors will have to purchase from the limited supply in circulation, this will support the Dexminer price, long term.
* The more Dexminer that is locked, the less new Dexminer is printed. This is due to the fact that when you lock your Dexminer to xDexminer  you receive the BUSD from the 4% of  Dexminer transaction volume and about 1.16% Dexminer rewards everyday compounded to 6,633.17% a year. If you don't lock your Dexminer you will receive 2.5% rewards everyday. So 50% less Dexminer is printed for all locked Dexminer which means less inflation.
* xDexminer  is a way for Dexminer holders to receive BUSD rewards, this means that holders don't need to sell their Dexminer to take profits or, if they do sell to take profits, they will sell less to realize their profit when added to the accumulated BUSD. So less selling pressure means better support price.
* Many people will appreciate their income in BUSD because it feels safe being pegged to the USD. Rewarding BUSD in this market makes Dexminer more attractive in the eyes of potential buyers, raising buying pressure and lowering selling pressure is achieved and this is very important for the project long term.
* New users will be comforted to see the diamond handed mentality of the Dexminer userbase, knowing that so many users have put such trust into a project, for such an extended period, in a climate where projects are failing after a few weeks, knowing that there is a strong core base of long term investors, who have locked their $Dexminer  for years, guaranteeing the foundation of the project, will help to stabilize and grow the value of the token over time.

Summary: As you can see by locking you Dexminer in the Dexminer bank, not only benefits you (return within 60 days) but also benefits all Dexminer holders and provides a great sense of community and longevity for new people entering into the system.

#### <mark style="background-color:purple;">3. Locking Mechanism explained.</mark>

The locking period will range from 1 week to 4 years, the basic idea is the longer the time you lock, the higher the number of xDexminer  you will have. You can only keep or increase the lock time, you cannot lower your lock time.

So before you lock your Dexminer you should consider how long you will commit your Dexminer to this function.

You can unlock your xDexminer  to Dexminer before the time ends but you can only receive 20% of what you locked, the rest, the remaining 80% will be burnt.

Therefore before locking your $DXM you should also decide how many percent of your Dexminer will be used to lock for XDexminer to receive passive income in Dexminer and BUSD.

When you calculated the percentage, let's say  for example that we will lock 30% of our total Dexminer , you should then decide how long you will lock your 30% Dexminer for xDexminer .

If you lock the Dexminer for 4 years, your exchange of Dexminer for xDexminer will be 1 Dexminer is equal to 1 xDexminer

if you lock your Dexminer for 1 year which is equal to 365 days, 1 Dexminer = 365 / (365\*4) = 0.25 xDexminer&#x20;

Of course if you are not satisfied, you can increase your lock at anytime to receive more xDexminer&#x20;

#### <mark style="background-color:purple;">4. How to calculate my daily BUSD rewards.</mark>

The rewards depend on 2 factors.

The first is daily volume.

The second is your share percentage of the total locked xDexminer&#x20;

If the daily volume is high but the number of locked xDexminer  is also high your rewards might be lower than on other days, but during this time you will still be getting your daily rewards paid out in Dexminer equal to 1.16%.

If the daily volume is high and the number of locked xDexminer  is low meaning you can have a larger percentage of the total xDexminer  you will receive a larger share of the rewards, and will also continue to receive your daily payout of 1.16% Dexminer also.

As you can see your daily takings in BUSD depend a lot on daily volume and how others are engaging with the Dexminer bank on a daily basis.&#x20;

The beauty of Dexminer Bank is there will be a period of fluctuation in the early days as things settle down, but as the nature of the token will push people to lock their tokens for the maximum amount of time, this will mean a large percentage of all tokens will be locked, so will not fluctuate daily, this means that over time the amount of BUSD received by a user will also level off over time, as people find a spot where their BUSD rewards satisfies their requirements.
