# ðŸš€ Generating Revenues with APY

**Given the high profitability in a short period of time, the following questions arise: how does Dexminer generate revenue to back up a high APY?**

Dexminer Finance enables its holders to extensively compound their investment and returns, as the protocol auto rewards its holders with **2.5%** a day with the compounding APY of <mark style="background-color:purple;">422,252.66%%</mark>  **** is rewarded every 2 seconds, 28800 times daily.

Seeing the size of this APY, one may wonder â€” how is such APY attainable?

Dexminer Finance leverages a number of revenue-generating mechanisms:

1. _<mark style="background-color:purple;">The protocol will use Defi 3.0 Multichain Farming to increase the Risk Insurrance Fund exponentially at a rate of \~100% a year or more to better support $DXM price floor.</mark>_

Unlike Titano which has a static LIT fund that does not yield profit, Dexminer Finance uses the Risk Insurrance Fund and the treasury fund to farm stable tokens through multichain farming. The Risk Insurrance funds are bridged to other EVM-compatible blockchains - like Avalanche, Fantom, Solana, Metis, Polygon, etc. to farm at the highest APY farms and the profit is then brought back to Dexminer and returned to the RIF.&#x20;

Dexminer Finance seeks yield-generating opportunities across different protocols and chains. This means that the Dexminer funds does not remains entirely on the BSC network, the money from the Treasury will be bridged to many other networks such as Fantom, Avalanche, Ethereum and any emerging blockchains which may have higher profit yield farms and substantial APYs. This strategy enabling Dexminer to deliver at least \~100% additional returns a year to better support $DXM price floor. That's why we are confident that we can support higher APY than other projects while still being sustainable  long term.

_<mark style="background-color:purple;">2. BNB Launchpad Earning</mark>_

The Binance Launchpad Subscription Format **allows BNB holders to commit an amount of BNB towards a Binance Fan Token sale**. The final allocation of the new token is determined by the ratio of their committed BNB against the total committed BNB by all participating users.&#x20;

A part of BNB in Risk Insurrance Fund will be transferred transparently to the Binance wallet of Dexminer Finance and keep that until the launchpad ends to receive the new tokens.

**One major advantage to launchpads is that they usually yield massive gains for investors**

The more BNB we have, the more new tokens we get. By selling new tokens, Dexminer Finance Team expected to generate 200% returns a year from Binance Launchpad (or launchpool) to support the APY in long term. This strategy is risk-free but very high reward.

_<mark style="background-color:purple;">3. Protocol-owned Liquidity</mark>_

Employing the use of protocol owned liquidity (POL) in combination with the underlying mechanics of Dexminer is a key distinction that enables Dexminer Finance to generate an additional revenue stream\
&#x20;(Pancakeswap give 0.25% of each transaction for Liquidity providers)  allowing it to deliver additional added value and increased APY to its token holders.

_<mark style="background-color:purple;">4. Slippage: 0% buy and 0 % sell fees</mark>_

The protocol takes a portion of the trading fees (buying and selling) and utilizes these to further sustain and back the protocol and its liquidity.

_<mark style="background-color:purple;">5. Automatic Mega Burn</mark>_

Every day, 0.2-0.4% of the total circulating supply will be burned. This percentage will evolve over the time based on our Automatic Mega Burn algorithm. The burn calculation will be updated daily according to the number of holders and the tokens held by each.

With our Mega burn program, 0.2-0.4% of total circulating supply is automatically burned daily, so Dexminer total supply will constantly be deflating against your balance, while your balance is constantly increasing against Dexminer 's total supply. This built-in mechanism creates a true supply/demand metric to the Dexminer token as it becomes ever scarcer against your balance with time.

In simple words, if you just hold Dexminer , your share of total market cap will be ever-increasing. Even if market cap remains stable (no new investors), the USD value of tokens in your wallet will still be growing. If the market cap raises by having new investors, your USD value of tokens will grow even more thanks to your share/total supply increasing continuously every day.
