# $WDEX

## WDEX - Wrapped Yield  Token by Dexminer Finance

Dxminer Finance will pioneer fixed APY tokens with a wrapped yield bearing version of its native token that is friendly with Centralized Exchanges.

### ðŸ”¥Why do we need WDEX?&#x20;

For getting listed on CEX (centralized exchange) and joining yield farming protocols . Once you have $DEX in your wallet, rebases happen every 15 minutes, and your $DEX amount will increase a 2.28% a day. You can't bring it on a Centralized Exchange like Binance because once you deposit on CEX, the amount of your token stops increasing. And the CEX cannot handle the rebase every 15 minutes for you.&#x20;

You also canâ€™t stake it in yield farming protocols because of the automated rebases. The amount of tokens when you withdraw is larger than the amount you staked because of rebases, and thatâ€™s something that no farm currently supports. That led to most farming protocols not providing pools for rebase tokens.

### ðŸ”¥How WDEX can be listed on CEX and participate in yield farming protocols?&#x20;

We will solve this problem by wrapping $DEX in a new token called WDEX. With our breakthrough technology, your $DEX can still grow 2.04% a day or 236,750.79% a year inside WDEX . You can wrap $DEX into WDEX and bring WDEX on any farms or transfer to any Centralized exchange. While the amount of WDEX stays the same, the number of $DEX inside it continues to grow. And at any time you can get all the original $DEX plus the rewarded $DEX from rebases by unwrapping WDEX .&#x20;

With WDEXwe can bring $DEX on any CEX like Gate.io, Binance, etc. where millions of new holders can get their hands on our tokens. We will form partnerships with a number of big CEXs and we will see $DEX grow exponentially in terms of brand and holders.&#x20;

This will be the next leap forward of Dexminer Finance and we will see it in action just after launch.

Here's a Quick Demo on Wrap/UnWrap $DEX. There is Zero Taxes on $WDEX. We will be doing Tutorials on how to use $WDEX and it's Utilities.
