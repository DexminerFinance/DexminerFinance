# 💸 $WDEX

## WDEX - Wrapped Yield  Token by Dexminer Finance

Dxminer Finance will pioneer fixed APY tokens with a wrapped yield bearing version of its native token that is friendly with Centralized Exchanges.

### 🔥Why do we need WDEX?&#x20;

For getting listed on CEX (centralized exchange) and joining yield farming protocols . Once you have $DEX in your wallet, rebases happen every 15 minutes, and your $DEX amount will increase a 2.28% a day. You can't bring it on a Centralized Exchange like Binance because once you deposit on CEX, the amount of your token stops increasing. And the CEX cannot handle the rebase every 15 minutes for you.&#x20;

You also can’t stake it in yield farming protocols because of the automated rebases. The amount of tokens when you withdraw is larger than the amount you staked because of rebases, and that’s something that no farm currently supports. That led to most farming protocols not providing pools for rebase tokens.

### 🔥How WDEX can be listed on CEX and participate in yield farming protocols?&#x20;

We will solve this problem by wrapping $DEX in a new token called WDEX. With our breakthrough technology, your $DEX can still grow 2.04% a day or 236,750.79% a year inside WDEX . You can wrap $DEX into WDEX and bring WDEX on any farms or transfer to any Centralized exchange. While the amount of WDEX stays the same, the number of $DEX inside it continues to grow. And at any time you can get all the original $DEX plus the rewarded $DEX from rebases by unwrapping WDEX .&#x20;

With WDEXwe can bring $DEX on any CEX like Gate.io, Binance, etc. where millions of new holders can get their hands on our tokens. We will form partnerships with a number of big CEXs and we will see $DEX grow exponentially in terms of brand and holders.&#x20;

This will be the next leap forward of Dexminer Finance and we will see it in action just after launch.

Here's a Quick Demo on Wrap/UnWrap $DEX. There is Zero Taxes on $WDEX. We will be doing Tutorials on how to use $WDEX and it's Utilities.
